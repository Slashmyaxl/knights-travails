# knights-travails

My primary goal is to create an algorithm that finds the shortest path of a knight from one square to another on a chess board. As a knight is able to legally move from any square on the board to another so long as it is allowed enough moves to do so, I believe this algorithm will require traversing through data structures.

Having just learned of graphs and how to implement them into JavaScript code, I plan to utilize this data structure in this project. A 2-dimensional array will be used to number the verticies (0-63), each corresponding to one square on the chess board. Another 2-dimensional array will then be used to identify the edge cases of each vertex.
